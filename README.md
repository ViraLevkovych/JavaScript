The Fortune Teller
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."

var numberOfChildren = 4;
var partnersName = "Queen Elizabeth";
var geographicLocation = "Willow Creeck";
var jobTitle = "Letsplayer";
alert ("You will be a " + jobTitle + " in " + geographicLocation + ", and married to " + partnersName + " with " + numberOfChildren + " kids." );
